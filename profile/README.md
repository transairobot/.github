## Hi there 👋
We are a startup specializing in affordable, multifunctional home robots and robot operating systems.

Our Vision:
+ Develop robotic tools to efficiently accomplish diverse tasks.
+ Shift computation to the cloud—robots only need minimal onboard processing.
+ Enable developers to create robot applications and host them on our cloud platform, allowing users to deploy apps with one click.
+ Keep hardware costs for mobile robotic arms under CNY 2,000.
